# Image Classification using CNN pytorch
 pytorch transfer learning + create CNN model

Inspired by the paper of [Cao and Choe,2020](https://github.com/thohoang87/image_classification_CNN_pytorch/blob/main/arxiv_DamageDetection_July4_csCV.pdf), we reproduced their work using Pytorch and torchvision instead of Keras and Tensorflow.
